# A simple jQuery program that helps creating to-dos list
I am enjoying learning to code so much. This is one of the jQuery exercise of the course I am taking. This simple program helps to add new to-dos to the list, cross the done work or delete them completely. Along with a beautiful background gradient from uigradients.com, the icons from Fontawesome are utilised to enhance the basic design with some css transitions.


Besides I got to learn 

> Placing files in better folder structure and 

> Got some ideas on organising CSS based on the specificity of selector where specificity refers to which CSS rule is first applied to the element.

Learnt from : Web Developer Bootcamp course Udemy
